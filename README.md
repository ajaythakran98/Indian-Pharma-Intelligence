## Key Insights

- **Paracetamol (N02BE)** and **Anxiolytics (N05B)** were the top-selling drug categories in India between 2014–2019, driven by consistent demand for pain relief and mental health treatment.
- These two categories, along with **Asthma/COPD (R03)** and **Ibuprofen (M01AB)**, accounted for **68% of total unit sales**, indicating a concentrated demand in essential therapeutic areas.
- The **top 10 most expensive medicines** were primarily chronic or specialty drugs offered by multinational brands — focused on low-volume, high-margin strategies.
- **Aceclofenac, Domperidone, and Cefixime** emerged as the most frequently used compositions, indicating dominance in pain, gastrointestinal, and antibiotic therapy.
- The Indian pharma market displays a **strong generic ecosystem**, with multiple brands offering similar formulations, leading to competitive clustering across key categories.
